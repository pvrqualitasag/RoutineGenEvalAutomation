This document gives an outline of some concepts proposed in the area of quality assurance (QA) and automation (AM)


# Introduction
According to R for Data Science [@WG2017], the following model of a data science project can be proposed. 

```{r DsProjectModel,echo=FALSE, odg.conv=TRUE, odg.path="odg", odg.out.dir="png", odg.graph.cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "png/DsProjectModel.png")
```

The model as defined above starts with importing the data into a statistics tool such as R. Hence, we assume that the data is available in a file in a pre-defined format or in a database in a specified set of tables.


## Componenents
The above shown components can be explained as follows

* __Import__: data must be imported first
* __Tidy__: data is cleaned, verified and converted into a standard format, where each data record is on one row and each variable is represented by one column. 
* __Transform__: after tidying certain variables are transformed where new variables can be computed from existing ones
* __Visualise__: shows properties of data that are not necessarily expected, but visualisations do not scale
* __Model__: are used to answer concrete questions and do scale well
* __Communicate__: presentation of results







```{r bib, include=FALSE}
s_bib_file <- "skeleton.bib"
vec_bref <- c(bibentry(
  bibtype = "Book",
  title = "R for Data Science",
  author = c(as.person("H. Wickham"), as.person("G. Grolemund")),
  year = "2017",
  publisher = "O'Reilly",
  url = "http://r4ds.had.co.nz/",
  key = "WG2017"
))

### # output to bib file
rmddochelper::write_bib(pvec_bref = vec_bref, ps_bibfile = s_bib_file)

# create a bib file for the R packages used in this document
# knitr::write_bib(c('base', 'rmarkdown'), file = 'skeleton.bib')
```
