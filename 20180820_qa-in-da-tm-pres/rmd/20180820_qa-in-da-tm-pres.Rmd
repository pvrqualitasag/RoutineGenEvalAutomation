```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::knit_hooks$set(hook_convert_odg = rmddochelper::hook_convert_odg)
```

## Concepts for Quality Assurance in Data Analyses

```{r da-time-period, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="8cm", hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="../odg"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../odg/da-time-period.png")
```
