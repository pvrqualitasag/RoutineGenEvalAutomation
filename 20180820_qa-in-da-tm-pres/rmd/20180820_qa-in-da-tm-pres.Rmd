## Concepts for Quality Assurance in Data Analyses

```{r da-time-period, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="9cm", hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="../odg"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../odg/da-time-period.png")
```

* Current focus on period after data analysis

## Reproducibility
* Only one concept seams relevant: __Reproducibility__
* ... is a minimal requirement for QA
* ... alone is no guarantee for good quality


## Definition
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility): 

> ... closeness of the agreement between the results of measurements of the same measurand carried out with same methodology ...

* In [@Peng2011]: 

> The standard of reproducibility calls for the data and the computer code used to analyze the data be made available to others.


## Reproducibility explained

```{r def-repro, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="11cm", hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="../odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "../odg/def-repro.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../odg/def-repro.png")
```


## Why Reproducibility?
According to http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/04/reproducible-data-science-with-r.html

* __Saves time__: easier to build efficient pipelines
* __Produces better science__: no usage of spurious results further down
* __Creates more trusted research__: results verified by trusted parties
* __Reduces the risk of errors__: such as losses during financial crisis
* __Encourages collaboration__: sharing of data and code is easier

 
## Ten Rules of Reproducibility [@Tait2017]
1. For every result, keep track of how it was produced
2. Avoid manual data manipulation
3. Archive the exact versions of all external programs used
4. Version control all custom scripts
5. Record all intermediate results
6. Note underlying random seeds
7. Always store raw data behind plots
8. Generate hierarchical analysis output, allowing layers of increasing detail to be inspected
9. Connect textual statements to underlying results
10. Provide public access to scripts, runs and results


## What does it mean for us

* Example: Pedigree export
    + Old: Starting export from GUI, passing parameter file, obtaining results $\rightarrow$ __cannot__ be made reproducible
    + New: Script generating parameter file, starting export $\rightarrow$ __can__ be made reproducible
* More Examples: ... (open for discussion)
