```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Time Periods Around a Data Analysis
```{r da_period, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width=720}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../odg/da_period.png")
```


## Data Analysis


## Reproducibility
- QA in data analysis (DA) is based on a single concept

$\rightarrow$ __Reproducbility__

- Definition: DA is reproducible, if and only if some else can come up with the same results

```{r reprodef, echo=FALSE, out.height=280, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../odg/reprodef.png")
```

- Reproducibility alone does not guarantee QA in DA


## Ten Rules

1. For Every Result, Keep Track of How It Was Produced
2. Avoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps
3. Archive the Exact Versions of All External Programs Used
4. Version Control All Custom Scripts
5. Record All Intermediate Results, When Possible in Standardized Formats
6. For Analyses That Include Randomness, Note Underlying Random Seeds
7. Always Store Raw Data behind Plots
8. Generate Hierarchical Analysis Output, Allowing Layers of Increasing Detail to Be Inspected
9. Connect Textual Statements to Underlying Results
10. Provide Public Access to Scripts, Runs, and Results


## Techniques
- Literate programming
- Templating
- Version control


## Tools
- git for version control
- R, Rmarkdown, knitr, for literate programming
- RStudio as general framework
- bash scripts for templating


## Applications
- Pedigree export
