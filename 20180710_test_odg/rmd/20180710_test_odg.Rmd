```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# conversion hook
knitr::knit_hooks$set(hook_convert_odg = rmddochelper::hook_convert_odg)
```


## Disclaimer
This is a test document for including odg-graphics into Rmd-source files.


## Graphics Creation
The odg-graphics files are first created using `rmddochelper::use_odg_graphics()` in a new R-code chunk.

```{r my_first_test_odg, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="../odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "../odg/my_first_test_odg.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../odg/my_first_test_odg.png")
```

The above result shows how to first convert and then include a graphics-object.



## Stuff from Template Is Below

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
